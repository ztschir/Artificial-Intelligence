2. In the current code, we detect the infinite loop by looking for a goal, action, and state combination that has been tried before. 

3. We fix the problem by skipping any action that has the goal, action, and state combination that was tried before. 

4. This should eventually give a solution for the general case, but it will not be optimal. It will more than likely be a few times longer than the optimal solution. It avoids the path on the second time through, but it doesn't remove the extra steps that it took.
