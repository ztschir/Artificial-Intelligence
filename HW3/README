In order to switch between each of the modes, find the self.mode variable in the init method and change the value. The value of 0 maps to the tabular mode, 1 to tiling mode, and 2 is nearest neighbors.


How we implemented Tiling:
We just created a map from the fine tiles to the course tiles and only stored the Q-values for the course tile. 

How we implemented Nearest Neighbor:
We used the previously created mapping and moved based on the three closest course tiles. Then after the "best" move was made based on the weights and Q values equation, we updated the three closest course tile neighbors.
